# Introduction
In recent years, there has been a growing recognition of the importance of mental health, particularly within the fast-paced and demanding environment of the technology sector. The tech industry, known for its innovation and progress, also faces unique challenges that can impact the mental well-being of its workforce. Long hours, high-pressure deadlines, and a culture that often glorifies overwork can contribute to stress, anxiety, and burnout among tech professionals. Additionally, issues such as imposter syndrome, isolation, and discrimination can further exacerbate mental health concerns within the tech community.

Raising awareness of mental health issues within the tech community and identifying any potential biases (such as gender, age, nationality) regarding these issues are essential steps towards fostering a more supportive and inclusive environment. Utilizing data collected over time, we can observe how the prevalence of these issues and the biases relating to them change, allowing us to tailor interventions and support mechanisms accordingly.
